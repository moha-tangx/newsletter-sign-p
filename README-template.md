## Overview
this is one of my earlist projects on frontend mentor, so this is intresting.
i  thopugh this would be hard but it ended up being simple.. so simple that i recreated an svg image provide for the project with css stylings..
but i didn't do the optimization for mobile view cause the thing started  getting boring after seeing that it's not even being responsive even with the desktop view
,things will just start being distorted and disorganized when window is resized.
need someone to help me with tips on making more responsive layouts..

## My process
started the day I took the chalange took a rest the day after to comback and macke the slightest change I can make to make it look as iodentical as possible o the design
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
with this project i learened more about colours,
generally i ignore using color name while chosing colors for my project,
i prefered playing around with my color selector provided by my ide(vs code),
but this project i use color names (thogh some converted to code) and putthem in a variable to improve consistancy across the pages

### TIP
for(vs code)
If you forget to put your strings in qoutes,highlight it then press shift + "(shif plus ");

### Continued development

i am palning on learning more of back-end for my web development
asyou can tell from my solution there is no any back-end (like js) langue used.
